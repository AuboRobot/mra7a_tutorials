# The mra7a_tutorials respository


**This repository shows some demos for controlling the mra7a by ROS.**<br>
1. The **moveit_visual_tools** package is the helper for displaying and debugging MoveIt! data in Rviz<br>
2. The **brain_control** stack is a demo for controling the motion of the mra7a by rrainâ€“computer interface.<br>
3. The **mra7a_random_motion** package is a demo controlling the MRA7a random motion.<br>
        running command: ```roslaunch mra7a_random_motion mra7a_random_motion.launch```  <br>
4. The **mra7a_eff_pose_plan** package is a simple program controlling the MRA7a's end effector to move to a specific point.<br>
        running command: <br>
        1.```roslaunch mra_control mra7a_trajectory_rviz.launch```   <br>
        2.```roslaunch rosrun mra7a_eff_pose_plan mra7a_eff_pose_plan_node```   <br>
      In the package, there is a folder named publish_pose_gui, which provides a GUI to publish end effector pose.<br>

5. The **mra7a_grasp_bottle_demo** package get object pose from [kinectv1_object_recognition](https://github.com/auboROS/kinectv1_object_recognition) , and plan the mra7a to grasp the object.<br>
*kinect-compute*r:<br>
        (1). ```roslaunch ork ork_demo.launch``` //Recognition the object and publish TF.<br>
        (2). ```roslaunch ork view_ork.launch``` //Rviz visualizaition.<br>
*arm-computer:*<br>
        (1). ```roslaunch mra_control mra7a_trajectory_rviz.launch``` //Server for controlling the mra7a.<br>
        (2). ```rosrun mra7a_grasp_bottle_demo grasp_bottle_demo_node``` //Get the bottle pose from TF tree and plan the mra7a to execute grasp motion.<br>
